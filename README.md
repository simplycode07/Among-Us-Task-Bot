# Among Us Task Bot

Okay, So I made this bot with pyautogui to automate wire task in Among Us. And to use it run the python program and then press Shift + W to start wire task, Shift + C to do card swipe and Shift + Q to quit the program.

It's a really basic program and to use it you have to change some values according to size of your screen. The default will work for screens with width = 1366 and height = 768.

Hope you like it :)
